    "# Part 1a: Classification with Decision Trees\n",
    "**DUE September 17th 2018**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for this project consists of several Python files, some of\n",
    "which you will need to read and understand in order to complete the\n",
    "assignment, and some of which you can ignore.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Files You'll Edit\n",
    "\n",
    "``assignment_1b.ipynb``: Will be your edited copy of this notebook pertaining to part 1a of the assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "`titanic-features.py`: This contains some functions to help you apply a decision tree to the Titanic dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Files you might want to look at\n",
    "  \n",
    "``binary.py``: Our generic interface for binary classifiers (actually\n",
    "works for regression and other types of classification, too).\n",
    "\n",
    "``datasets.py``: Where a handful of test data sets are stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "``util.py``: A handful of useful utility functions: these will\n",
    "undoubtedly be helpful to you, so take a look!\n",
    "\n",
    "``runClassifier.py``: A few wrappers for doing useful things with\n",
    "classifiers, like training them, generating learning curves, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "``mlGraphics.py``: A few useful plotting commands\n",
    "\n",
    "``data/*``: all of the datasets we'll use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What to Submit\n",
    "\n",
    "You will hand in all of the python files listed above under \"Files\n",
    "you'll edit\". You will also have to answer the written questions in this\n",
    "notebook denoted **Q#:** in the corresponding cells denoted with **A#:**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Autograding\n",
    "\n",
    "Your code will be autograded for technical correctness. Please **do\n",
    "not** change the names of any provided functions or classes within the\n",
    "code, or you will wreak havoc on the autograder. However, the\n",
    "correctness of your implementation -- not the autograder's output --\n",
    "will be the final judge of your score.  If necessary, we will review\n",
    "and grade assignments individually to ensure that you receive due\n",
    "credit for your work."
